# 🚉 Metro Station Distance Finder Using Dijkstra's Algorithm 

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path (in terms of distance) between a source station and all other stations in a city metro system. The graph represents metro stations, where each station is connected to neighboring stations by a fixed distance.

## 📋 Project Overview

•⁠  ⁠*Language:* C++
•⁠  ⁠*Graph Representation:* Adjacency list using vectors
•⁠  ⁠*Algorithm Used:* Dijkstra’s Algorithm
•⁠  ⁠*Total Stations:* 53
•⁠  ⁠*Distance Between Stations:* Fixed (1 km)

The program allows a user to input a source station and displays the shortest distance from the source to all other stations in the metro system.

## ⚙️ Features

•⁠  ⁠Calculates the shortest path from the source station to all other stations.
•⁠  ⁠Displays the distances in a user-friendly format with station names and distances.
•⁠  ⁠Efficiently handles multiple connections using a priority queue (implemented via ⁠ set ⁠ in C++).
•⁠  ⁠Handles unreachable stations.

## 🛠 How It Works

1.⁠ ⁠*Input:* The user selects the source station from the list of 53 available stations.
2.⁠ ⁠*Dijkstra's Algorithm:* The algorithm computes the shortest distance from the source station to all connected stations.
3.⁠ ⁠*Output:* Displays the distance of all stations from the source.

## 📍 Metro Station Network

The graph is built using an adjacency list, where each node represents a station, and edges between nodes represent a 1 km distance between connected stations.

*Example of a few station connections:*

⁠ cpp
graph[0] = {{1, 1}};
graph[1] = {{0, 1}, {2, 1}};
graph[2] = {{1, 1}, {3, 1}};
